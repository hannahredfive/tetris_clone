# tetris_clone
This is my Capstone Project for Ada Developer's Academy. I decided to make a Tetris Clone is C++ using SDL2.


## What does it look like?
Start screen. Pressing spacebar triggers game state change.

Gameplay. Time is tracked for during this gameplay only.

When you cannot add a new tetromino to the board in a legal move, then the game over state is triggered. Pressing enter changes the game state to the start menu state.
